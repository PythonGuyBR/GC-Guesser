## About

GC-Guesser is a lightweight, terminal-based tool that generates and tests Roblox gift card codes based on common formatting patterns. Designed for fun and experimentation.

---

## Features

- Fast generation of randomized Roblox gift card codes  
- Simple, command-line interface  
- No external dependencies — easy to run

---

## How It Works

GC-Guesser creates gift card codes that mimic the standard Roblox formatting conventions. It then sends requests to Roblox's servers to check if a code is valid.

> **Note:** This tool interacts directly with Roblox’s servers via their `/redeem` endpoint, so you need an internet connection or it'll not be able to check giftcard codes validity.
